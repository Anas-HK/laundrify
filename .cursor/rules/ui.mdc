# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

Whatever route I give you, update the UI of it matching with the rest of the work we've done so far. Also write css in external file to keep view blade file clean

don't add any routes by yourself, if you're adding routes add the same ones in the existing files or check [web.php](mdc:routes/web.php) route file
